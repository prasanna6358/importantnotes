How to Work with LDAP Server?

First you need to install openLDAP server in your local System then install phpldapadmin GUI

To do the operation on LDAP server we are using phpldapadmin

first thing you have to setup LDAP server with proper settings like domain name , organisation name and admin password etc.

First create simple Organization units in LDAP server then ad users to the unit.

if you know dont know to create organization units and creating user just follow the link :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM_UQVVVtoY


if everything working fine then will go for java programming

First thing we have to do that we have to configure basic requirements i.e
We have to setUp the following things

1). URL = "ldap://localhost"
2). Connection = "simple"
3). admindn = "cn=somename, dn=somename,dn=local //with which you have created the LDAP server, This is basically with what you are able to login i.e Login DN
4). Password = "Password"

Configure all the required things with HashTable like
                      Hashtable<String, String> environment = new Hashtable<String, String>();
                      environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
                      environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, url);
                      environment.put(Context.OBJECT_FACTORIES,"java.naming.factory.object");
                      environment.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, connectionType);
                      environment.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, adminDN);
                      environment.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);

 and then             DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext(environment);

First do the basic opeartion of LDAP server opeartion lookUp(String lookupDNname )

And add a parameter for this operation to give the i/p as dn wether it is exists r not.

if the spacified dn exists it will give the class name as LdapCtx else it will give you error message as object does not exist.

then come to the second operation i.e createEntry(String entryDN,Attributes attributes)

Give the correct entryDn otherwise you will get error as InvalidNameException

If you are giving the  attributes as null then also you will get the error.

and give the required attributes i.e
         Attribute cn = new BasicAttribute("cn", "john kumar");
        Attribute givenName = new BasicAttribute("givenname", "john");
        Attribute sn = new BasicAttribute("sn","kumar");
        Attribute objectclass = new BasicAttribute("objectclass", "posixAccount");
        Attribute objectStructuralclass = new BasicAttribute("objectclass", "inetOrgPerson");

 Above are the required attributes if you want you can give more attributes

 we are adding this attributes to this thing => Attributes attr = new BasicAttributes(true);

                    attr.put(cn);
                    attr.put(givenName);
                    attr.put(sn);
                    attr.put(objectclass);
                    attr.put(objectStructuralclass);

then call the method ctx.CreatesubContext(entryDN, attributes);

if everything working fine it will create the new entry with the metioned entryDn and with the attributes
if the mentioned entryDN already exists in the LDAP server then it will show the error as entry already Exists.
