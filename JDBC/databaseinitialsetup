create user in MYSQL and Giving permissions

Create a database in MySQL. Let's create a database javabase. You of course want World Domination, so let's use UTF-8 as well.

CREATE DATABASE javabase DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;

Create an user for Java and grant it access. Simply because using root is a bad practice.

CREATE USER 'java'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL ON javabase.* TO 'java'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Yes, java is the username and password is the password here.

Determine the JDBC URL. To connect the MySQL database using Java you need an JDBC URL in the following syntax:

jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/databasename

sample Programme
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase";
String username = "java";
String password = "password";

System.out.println("Connecting database...");

try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)) {
    System.out.println("Database connected!");
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot connect the database!", e);
}

create user in ORACLE and Giving permissions

after installation of Oracle database connect to the databse using
use the command sqlplus/nolog tyhen after
SQL>command: connect sys as sysdba 
it will ask for password give the password which you have given at the time of installation

Now create user and grant permissions

CREATE USER Prasanna IDENTIFIED BY Password;

GRANT CONNECT TO prasanna;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO prasanna;

GRANT CREATE SESSION GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE TO prasanna;

GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO prasanna;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON schema.books TO prasanna;

grant all privilege to prasanna;
