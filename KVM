What is a hypervisor?

KVM is a hypervisor that creates and run virtual machines. 
A server on which a hypervisor is running is called as a host machine. 
Each virtual machine is referred to as a guest machine. Using KVM, you can run multiple operating systems
such as CentOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MS-Windows running unmodified.

Steps for installing KVM on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS

The host server located in the remote data center and it is a headless server.
All commands in this tutorial typed over the ssh based session.
You need a vnc client to install the guest operating system.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to install KVM software on Ubuntu and use KVM to setup your first guest VM.
Find out if server is capable of running hardware accelerated KVM vm

You need to use the kvm-ok command to determine if the server can host hardware accelerated KVM virtual machines. First install cpu-checker package using the following apt-get command:
$ sudo apt-get install cpu-checker

Next, run the following command:
$ sudo kvm-ok

Sample outputs:
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
Install kvm on Ubuntu Linux

Type the following apt-get command to install kvm and related software:
$ sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin virtinst bridge-utils

Default configuration locations

Default directory: /var/lib/libvirt/
ISO images for installation: /var/lib/libvirt/boot/
VM installation directory: /var/lib/libvirt/images/
Libvirt configuration directory for LVM/LXC/qemu: /etc/libvirt/



More about the default networking for VM

The default networking is called ‘default’. To list networks, enter:
$ sudo virsh net-list

For network information, enter:
$ sudo virsh net-info default

Sample outputs:

Name:           default
UUID:           1c0abaa3-8d17-45b5-85e9-c0d48cec94f9
Active:         yes
Persistent:     yes
Autostart:      yes
Bridge:         virbr0


To dump network information in XML format, enter:
$ sudo virsh net-dumpxml default

Sample outputs:

<network connections='1'>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>1c0abaa3-8d17-45b5-85e9-c0d48cec94f9</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
