Wireshark, a network analysis tool formerly known as Ethereal, captures packets in real time and
display them in human-readable format. Wireshark includes filters, color-coding and other features
that let you dig deep into network traffic and inspect individual packets.

You’ll probably see packets highlighted in green, blue, and black. Wireshark uses colors to help 
you in identify the types of traffic at a glance. By default, green is TCP traffic, dark blue is DNS traffic, 
light blue is UDP traffic, and black identifies TCP packets with problems — for example, they could have been 
delivered out-of-order.
