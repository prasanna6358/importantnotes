Bitnami is an app library for server software

Bitnami Cloud Hosting simplifies the process of deploying and managing open source and other applications on the Amazon Cloud. 
It provides one-click deployment for a vast library of tested, ready-to-run applications, such as Alfresco, Drupal, SugarCRM, 
Wordpress, Joomla!, Redmine and many others.

Bitnami offers users automated application deployments of open source server apps from Oracle Cloud, 
Amazon EC2 and Google Cloud Platform servers.[3]



 Bitnami Installers

Bitnami native installers automate the setup of a Bitnami-packaged application on Windows, 
Mac OS X or Linux. Each installer includes all of the software necessary to run out of the box (the stack). 
The process is simple, only requiring you to download, enter basic information and install. 
Bitnami stacks are also completely self contained; they bundle all the required libraries, 
databases, and runtimes and will not interfere with other software on your system.


Bitnami Virtual Machines

Bitnami virtual machine images, also known as virtual appliances, contain a minimal Linux operating system and a fully 
installed and configured Bitnami application. Using a virtualization platform like VMware or VirtualBox, 
you can simply start the Bitnami virtual machine image whenever you want to use the application. 
This allows you to keep it completely isolated from software installed on your machine.
