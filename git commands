git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.

This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:
git reset
This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):

git checkout .
You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:

git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]
Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):
git reset --hard HEAD
This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:

git clean -fdx
WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files!

New branches are created with the command
$ git branch branchname
By default this branch is a copy of the current branch (the one you were at when running the command) at HEAD. You can also create a copy that only includes changes up to a certain commit by adding the SHA of the commit:
$ git branch branchname commit-SHA
To list all existing branches use:
git branch

This also shows the branch you are currently on, marked with an asterisk next to the name.

To delete a branch, use
$ git branch -d branchname
