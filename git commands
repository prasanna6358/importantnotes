git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.

This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:
git reset
This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):

git checkout .
You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:

git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]
Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):
git reset --hard HEAD
This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:

git clean -fdx
WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files!
